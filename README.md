# Project Week 6:
Sixth project of the "Became a Software Developer" course.

# Date:
25/10/2021

# Description:
This week's project was about adding an HTTP request to the "subscribe" page we created last week. In case the validation was ok, the data had to be submited to a fictional server URL, and then display a "modal" showing the correct or incorrect subscription.
If the request worked, the recieved data (from server) had to be saved on LocalStorage and then auto-loaded already in the inputs.

# Disclaimer:
It's very likely that the server will stop working properly after some time, so maybe if you try this in the future there will be request errors only when trying to fetch!
